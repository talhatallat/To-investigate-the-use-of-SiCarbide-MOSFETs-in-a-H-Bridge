# To-investigate-the-use-of-SiCarbide-MOSFETs-in-a-H-Bridge
Electric drives are becoming very important in many industries, for example Electric Cars. It is important that the power electronics is as efficient as possible. SiCarbide MOSFETs have significant benefits when compared to traditional Si MOSFet technology. This project investigates the use of these SiCarbide MOSFETs
