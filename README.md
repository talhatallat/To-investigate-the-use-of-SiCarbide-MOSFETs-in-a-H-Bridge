Objective: To investigate the use of SiCarbide MOSFETs in a H-Bridge

## Description: 
Electric drives are becoming very important in many industries, for example Electric Cars. It is important that the power electronics is as efficient as possible. SiCarbide MOSFETs have significant benefits when compared to traditional Si MOSFet technology. This project investigates the use of these SiCarbide MOSFETs

## Key Outcomes:
Construction and testing of a SiCarbide MOSFETs based H-bridge. The controller and gate drive system will also be built and tested.

## Risk Assessment Category:

## Project Themes:

## Other Details: 
Skills to be developed.
Construction of high power, appros 1KW power electronics switching at relatively high speeds 100KHz.
Programming a microcontroller to control and test the bridge.
Instrumentation setup to test the system.
