### **First Response Procedures**
This outlines the immediate response to various emergencies. The purpose of these guidelines is to enable campus users to quickly and decisively respond to an actual or potential emergency, which could threaten the safety of persons, cause damage to property or equipment or disrupt campus operations.

### **TU Dublin Emergency Management Policy and Plan**
The University’s Emergency Management Policy and Plan provides a framework for planning and managing the response to an emergency or disaster to ensure the safety of its employees, students, campus users and the effective continuity of business-critical systems. A copy of this is available here. 

### **Assembly Points**
The Assembly Points are designated areas of safety where people assemble following an evacuation. The Assembly Points for each building are decided upon by the Safety Steering Group, details are available from this location finder and posted locally on signage.

### **Evacuation of People with Disabilities**
People with disabilities requiring assistance with evacuation are requested to give advance notification to the Safety, Health and Welfare Office/Estates function prior to arrival on campus or as soon as possible thereafter (SHW@TUDublin.ie). This is to ensure that an assessment of their needs can be carried out and a Personal Emergency Egress Plan (PEEP) developed if appropriate. The requirements of the PEEP are implemented by the Estates Office where feasible.

Where available, refuge points/areas provide a safe place for a specified period while awaiting assistance. They are normally sited within a fire-safe enclosure such as a protected lobby, corridor or stairwell and are marked locally with signage. The individual PEEPs outline the details of the action to be taken in the event of an emergency evacuation.
### **Everyone's responsibility as an evacuation marshal**
All employees are required to act as evacuation marshals during an evacuation.

The main role of an evacuation marshal is to carry out a “sweep/search” of rooms in their area and instruct all occupants to leave the building promptly by the nearest and safest exit and report to the Assembly Point.

They report information about their area to the Incident Controller outside the building. Evacuation marshals are advised not put themselves in any danger while undertaking their duties.  The role and duty of an evacuation marshal is covered in Emergency Response Training

### **Evacuation Safety during COVID-19**
Whilst control measures to protect against COVID-19 continue to be crucial, fire safety remains a priority. With careful consideration it is possible to balance both hazards.

Evacuations have the potential to increase the risk of Coronavirus transmission due to the movement of large numbers of people in close proximity.

The following highlights simple controls to ensure the risk of Coronavirus transmission is reduced as far as reasonably practicable during our evacuations:

* Individuals should consider the use of a dispersal system at the Assembly points. The key element is to take personal responsibility to remain socially distanced. Evacuation marshals are requested during these challenging times to assist and take collective responsibility with the directing of individuals to remain physically distanced during evacuation; 

* All individuals should wear face coverings for the duration of the practice drill even when outdoors (at times when face coverings are deemed mandatory). This is an extra measure we would like to enforce due to the large numbers who will be evacuating; 

* Returning into buildings should be undertaken in staged intervals to minimise for the potential for spread; 
* and Ensure you practice good hygiene etiquette at all times.

### **First -aid Response Plans for medical conditions**
All students, staff members, visitors/ campus users with an underlying medical condition are advised to;


• Wear an information necklace/ bracelet identifying his/ her condition or carry a medical ID wallet card
• Carry on their person at all times any medication required
• Inform relevant staff/ colleagues/ Line Manager/ event organiser
• Register with the TU Dublin City Campus Disability Service (students

There is a list of Generic First Response Plans available at this link to give guidance on how to deal with seizures, panic/heart attacks, fainting, diabetes, epilepsy etc.

### **If you Discover Fire/Emergency Situation or hear the Evacuation Alarm**
**If you discover a fire/emergency situation**
• Activate the nearest fire alarm call point;
• Alert the front desk /reception if possible;
• Follow the evacuation procedure.

 
**If you hear the evacuation alarm**
• Proceed to evacuate without delay, do not wait for further information or instruction;
• If there is time and it is safe to do so, shut down electricity and gas and close doors and windows;
• Leave the building using the nearest emergency exit;
• Do not use the lift;
• Form a single file on stairways and corridors and leave the centre passageway clear for emergency access;
• If you encounter crowd congestion, smoke or other danger proceed to another exit if possible;
• Disperse from the building and report to the designated Assembly Point; 
• Do not re-enter the building until the “all clear” has been given.

### **Evacuation**
**Plans - Standard Operating Procedure**

Lecturers/event hosts are responsible for their students/attendees under their supervision and must make themselves aware (or, if visiting, must be made aware) of the fire procedures pertaining to the buildings in which they lecture/host events. On hearing the evacuation alarm, the lecturer/event host must ensure that persons under his or her supervision are made aware of the Assembly Point(s) and that they leave the building by the nearest and safest available exit route(s) in a calm and orderly manner.

**Evacuation Drills**

Weekly fire alarm tests are carried out by the Estates Office and/or the management company. Evacuation drills are held each semester (one day-time drill and one evening/night-time drill (where appropriate).

Most of the University’s premises have transient populations and therefore “Roll Call” type evacuation procedures are not regarded as viable.  TU Dublin utilise the Evacuation Marshall system. This is where the evacuated building is declared clear of people, rather than people being accounted for at the assembly area (as in a "Roll Call").

**Evacuation Evaluation**

Any issues or difficulties that arise during an evacuation, or suggestions for improvement, must be reported through the online evacuation evaluation form 

### **TU Dublin EverReady Programme**
This refers to TU Dublin emergency preparedness efforts including written procedures and guidelines, training and response. It was developed to help TU Dublin and our campus community to prevent and prepare for and respond to emergencies.

* First response procedures
* TU Dublin Emergency Plan
* Emergency Contacts
* Help Numbers
* Out of hours contact numbers
* AED listing
* Listing of first-aiders
* Location finder
* Assembly Points
* Supports

### **Social Media during Emergencies**
Social media has become a critical component to deliver news faster and to a wider audience than traditional news sources for emergencies. This however has the potential for misinformation. Members of the TU Dublin community should refrain from spreading emergency information on their personal social media and should also refrain from sharing images relating to emergencies.

All queries in relation to communications in emergency scenarios should be referred to the Communications and Marketing Function.
